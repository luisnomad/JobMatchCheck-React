# Job Match Topic Feature

The Job Match Topic Feature is a tool that allows you to evaluate job offers based on specific criteria and determine whether they align with your preferences. This feature helps you save time and effort by filtering out irrelevant offers and focusing on the ones that truly match your requirements.

## Features

- Evaluate job offers based on predefined topics such as job type, technology, position type, and job details.
- Assign scores to each option within a topic to quantify the level of match.
- Set thresholds for dealbreakers and promising offers.
- Easily customize and integrate the feature into your website or application.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the JobMatchApp (or its contents) whenever you want in the app, and include the **MatchForm** component from its path.
3. Customize the topics and scoring system to fit your specific needs.
4. Deploy your site or application with the Job Match Topic Feature implemented.

NOTE: I am using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), hence you'll see some classNames there that you might want to remove if you're using something else (although you'll need to style the elements yourself!). Still, there is some custom CSS that you'll still be able to use.

## Documentation

For more instructions on how to use and customize the Job Match Topic Feature, you'll find detailed comments in the code itself.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request, although this is a quick and dirty repo that doesn't have a lot of what would be needed to be considered an open source project. I might work on that, if I find the time though!
